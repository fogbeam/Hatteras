{"name":"Hatteras","tagline":"Business Events Subscription Engine","body":"Hatteras\r\n========\r\n\r\nHatteras is a Business Event Subscriptions Engine from [Fogbeam Labs](http://www.fogbeam.com). \r\nPart of the [Fogcutter project](http://code.google.com/p/fogcutter), Hatteras provides a \r\nbridge between your Enterprises ESB/SOA infrastructure and  user-facing applications, by allowing users to define \r\nsubscriptions to business events they are interested in. Hatteras delivers matching messages to the user application \r\nfor display, additional processing, or other interaction.  Hatteras can also route events to other consumers including\r\nEnterprise Social Networks, Semantic Processing Pipelines, Analytics Engines, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHatteras currently interoperates with [Quoddy](http://code.google.com/p/quoddy) - the Enterprise Social Network component of Fogcutter - to allow users \r\nto have Business Events rendered into their Event Stream alongside Status Updates, Calendar Events, and other \r\nActivityStream items.\r\n\r\nHatteras is written in Java and makes heavy use of Apache Camel for message routing. In it's current form, Hatteras \r\nuses XQuery expressions for matching XML messages \"off the wire\" and includes support for the OAGIS vocabulary. \r\nSubsequent work will add support for xCBL and OASIS UBL as well as customer-defined schemas and vocabularies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial Support\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nCommercial support is available from [Fogbeam Labs](http://www.fogbeam.com).  \r\n","google":"UA-2911364-13","note":"Don't delete this file!
